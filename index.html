            <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr>DOM</abbr>s, and broken <abbr>CSS</abbr> support.</p>
            <p>Today, we must clear the mind of past practices. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr> and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>CSS1k invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the (yet to be) time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

            <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
            <p<There is clearly a need for <abbr>CSS</abbr> to be taken seriously by graphic artists. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external .css file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p><abbr>CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. To date, most examples of neat tricks and hacks have been demonstrated by structurists and coders. Designers have yet to make their mark. This needs to change.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Participation</h2>
            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr>HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
            <p>Download the sample <a href="index.html" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified."><abbr>HTML</abbr> file</a> and <a href="default.css" title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify."><abbr>CSS</abbr> file</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your .css file to a web server under your control. <a href="/submit/" title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to the file and if we choose to use it, we will spider the associated images. Final submissions will be placed on our server.</span></p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to when making the case for <abbr>CSS</abbr>-based design. This is sorely needed, even today. More and more major sites are taking the leap, but not enough have. One day this gallery will be a historical curiosity; that day is not today.</p>
