If you want to make life easier for me, please follow these guidelines:

 * Submit one easily readable main CSS file with all necessary vendor prefixes included
 * Also submit one minified version of the same file, with only the non prefixed properties included. This is the file that needs to be 1024 bytes or less.
 * Add a link to your stylesheet in index.html

You should be able to figure it out by looking at the current examples.

Thanks!
